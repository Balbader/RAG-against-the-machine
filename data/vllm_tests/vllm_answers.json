    "question": "What is vLLM and what are its main features?",
    "answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the question. The user is asking, \"What is vLLM and what are its main features?\" and needs a comprehensive answer based only on the provided context. \n\nFirst, I need to look through all the sources given. The context mentions vLLM's models and features. Let me check each source:\n\nIn Source 1, it says vLLM supports models in <gh-file:vllm/model_executor/models>. Also, models are listed in supported-text-models and supported-mm-models. That's about the models they support.\n\nSource 2 has examples of using vLLM in online serving, like making API calls with different text formats. The code shows how to handle strings and lists for text inputs. Also, there's benchmarking with a custom dataset in .jsonl format. So, main features include model support, API handling, online serving, and custom dataset benchmarking.\n\nSource 3 mentions a Custom Dataset section, which is about benchmarking with a dataset. So, main features include supporting custom datasets and being flexible for different data formats.\n\nSource 4 talks about multi-modal data processing using BaseMultiModalProcessor. That's a feature related to handling multiple modal data.\n\nSource 5 shows how vLLM works with different models, like vlm2vec and dse_qwen2_vl, which are specific models used in the examples. But the main features here are the model types and their respective processing.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should include:\n\n- vLLM's main features: model support, API handling, online serving, custom dataset benchmarking, and multi-modal data processing via BaseMultiModalProcessor. Also, mention that the examples use various text and image formats.\n\nWait, the user asked for a comprehensive answer based on the context. The context does mention all these aspects, so the answer should list them concisely. Make sure not to include any information not in the context.\n</think>\n\nvLLM is a language model engine that supports various model configurations and features. Here's a comprehensive answer based on the context:\n\n1. **Model Support**: vLLM supports a wide range of models, including those listed in `supported-text-models` and `supported-mm-models`.  \n2. **API Handling**: It enables online serving by providing APIs to interact with models, allowing tasks like text scoring or embedding with different data formats (strings, lists, or images).  \n3. **Custom Dataset Benchmarking**: It supports benchmarking with custom datasets in `.jsonl` format, where each entry includes \"prompt\" fields.  \n4. **Multi-Modal Processing**: vLLM uses `BaseMultiModalProcessor` to handle multi-modal data, enabling seamless integration of image and text inputs.  \n5. **Flexibility**: It supports both text and image-based tasks, with examples like embedding images or embedding text.  \n\nThese features make vLLM versatile for different use cases, including text processing, online serving, and multi-modal data handling.",

    "question": "How does vLLM achieve high throughput?",
    "answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking how vLLM achieves high throughput based on the provided context. Let me look through the sources again.\n\nFirst, Source 3 mentions that the script iterates through combinations of max_num_seqs and max_num_batched_tokens. Then, the process includes benchmarking with an infinite request rate and checking latency. If the P99 E2E latency is within a limit, that's the maximum throughput. Also, there's a recommendation for max_num_batched_tokens > 8096 for smaller models on large GPUs. Source 4 talks about finding the optimal parameters by first determining safe gpu-memory-utilization, then iterating through combinations, and using the vLLM server to find the best result with latency constraints. \n\nWait, but the question is about achieving high throughput, not just the process. So the answer should combine all these points. The key points are the parameter tuning process, using the server's capabilities, and the batch size recommendations. Also, the fact that they use the server to find the best throughput with latency. So the answer needs to mention that the script optimizes parameters like batch size and memory, uses server benchmarks to find max throughput, and that certain values (like batch size) are optimal for specific models. Also, the recommendation for larger GPUs. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any parts from the sources that aren't relevant. Source 2's throughput test is about input and output lengths, but that's not directly related. Source 1's figure shows connectors, but that's not relevant here. So the answer should summarize the process steps mentioned in the context.\n</think>\n\nvLLM achieves high throughput through a systematic parameter optimization process:  \n\n1. **Parameter Tuning**: It iterates through combinations of `max_num_seqs` and `max_num_batched_tokens` to find the optimal parameters.  \n2. **Server Benchmarking**: It benchmarks with an infinite request rate (`--request-rate inf`) and checks latency constraints. If a throughput is valid (within a defined latency limit), it records it as the maximum for that configuration.  \n3. **Batch Size Optimization**:  \n   - Smaller values (e.g., `max_num_batched_tokens = 2048`) improve inter-token latency due to fewer prefills.  \n   - Larger values (e.g., > 8096) balance latency and throughput.  \n4. **Latency Constraints**: The process ensures the highest sustainable throughput by iteratively decreasing the request rate until latency is met.  \n\nThis approach balances model efficiency, memory usage, and performance with the vLLM server\u2019s capabilities.",
